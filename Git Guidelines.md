# Making a Commit

## Guidelines
- Commit messages should always use the imperative voice (i.e. Add vs. Adding, Make vs. Made)
- Commit messages should be multi-line, containing a title, body, and issue reference, unless they can be categorized as a repository chore

## Templates

1. **When working on, but not completing, an issue**:  

   _[Message Title]_  

   _[Message Body]_  

   Contributes to #_[Issue Number]_  
 
2. **When completing an issue**:

   _[Message Title]_  

   _[Message Body]_  

   Resolves #_[Issue Number]_
