# Outline
## What is AWS?
Amazon Web Service is a major cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. 
AWS offers a plethora of services that are broken into different categories:
* Analytics
* Application Integration
* AR & VR
* Blockchain
* Compute
* Containers
* Database
* Internet of things
* Networking
* Security
* Storage

AWS allows developers to deploy dynamic and static applications, manage user groups and permissions, store files and data, and much more. 
AWS follows a pay-as-you-go model which allows users to only pay for computing time and not for entire services

AWS has regions all across the world and within each region there are availability zones which are one or more discrete data centers.

## AWS Interfaces

There are 3 main interfaces used to communicate with AWS

* AWS Console
* SDKs (Software Development Kits)
* AWS CLIv2

### AWS Console

The AWS Management Console is the main place where you can visually see all the AWS Services <br>
The console can lead you to documentation on all the services, training and AWS certifications.


### SDKs

SDKs (Software Development Kits) allows developers to automate AWS tasks in code. <br>
AWS offers SDKs for C++, Go, Java, Javascript, Python3 and many more programming languages <br>
You can find all the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html#sdks) for each SDK on the AWS documentation site.

### AWS CLIv2

Finally AWS offers an expansive CLI (Command Line Interface) that allows developers to communicate with any service through the command line. <br>
We use the CLI to deploy our applications on circleCI through the config.yml file <br>
All [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/?id=docs_gateway) for the AWS CLI can be found on their site
