## What is AWS?
Amazon Web Service is a major cloud computing platform provided by Amazon. 
AWS offers a plethora of services that are broken into different categories:
* Analytics
* Application Integration
* AR & VR
* Blockchain
* Compute
* Containers
* Database
* Internet of things
* Networking
* Security
* Storage

AWS allows developers to deploy dynamic and static applications, manage user groups and permissions, store files and data, and much more. 
AWS follows a pay-as-you-go model which allows users to only pay for computing time and not for entire services

AWS has regions all across the world and within each region there are availability zones which are one or more discrete data centers.
