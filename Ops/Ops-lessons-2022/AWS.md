#### ElasticBeanstalk Resources:
- Used to easily deploy, monitor, and scale web applications and services
- It provisions and operates the infrastructure your application needs as well as the application stack itself. This allows for developers to spend more time writing code rather than managing and configuring servers, load balancers, networks, and firewalls. 
- Will automatically scale compute resources when traffic is high and scale down when it is low to minimize cost and optimize availability.  

#### SecurEd Use Cases:
- We currently deploy CLARK-Gateway, change-authorship-service, standard-guidelines-service, and cards-service.
