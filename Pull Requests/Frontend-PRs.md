## Guidelines

Frontend PRs should contain screenshots of created or edited UI.

### Screenshots

If any UI that a customer can see is created or edited significantly, such as the case where a button option is added to a dropdown, then screenshots of the UI should be provided.  This is necessary because it makes reviewing UI easier.  You should also include mobile screenshots if a mobile view was part of the requirements of the story.
